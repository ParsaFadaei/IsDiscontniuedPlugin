# IsDiscontniuedPlugin
This is a Plugin for NopCommerce 4.1 that adds a discontinued feature to products that you can edit through the administration.
Also you can edit and filter the products from the discontinued feature on the bulk edit page.
I've also added a small feature that you can filter your products by store in the bulk edit menu.
